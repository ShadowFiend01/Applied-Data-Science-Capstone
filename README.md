# IBM Data Science Capstone Project - SpaceX

## Introduction

This capstone project aims to predict whether the Falcon 9 rocket’s first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 launches on its website at a cost of 62 million dollars, significantly lower than other providers charging upwards of 165 million, mainly due to SpaceX’s ability to reuse the first stage. By predicting the likelihood of a successful first stage landing, we can estimate launch costs, providing competitive insights for any company bidding against SpaceX for rocket launches.

## Business Problem
SpaceX's competitive advantage partly arises from its reusable Falcon 9 rocket stages, reducing launch costs to 62 million dollars compared to other providers' costs of up to 165 million. If successful landings can be accurately predicted, the startup employing this data science project can make well-informed bids for launch services against SpaceX.

## Objective
- To apply data science and machine learning to predict the success likelihood of Falcon 9's first stage landing, aiding in accurate launch cost estimations.
- To explore data for extracting actionable insights.

## Business Metric
Classification accuracy, defined as:
\[
Accuracy = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + FP + TN + FN}
\]
